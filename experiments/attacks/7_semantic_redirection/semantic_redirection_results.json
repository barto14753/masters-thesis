Here's a simplified example of how you might create such a Python script using the `keyboard` library. Note that this is a basic implementation and doesn't include data storage or analytics, but it should give you a good starting point:\n\n```python\nimport keyboard\nimport time\n\n# Initialize variables for typing speed and pattern analysis\ntyping_start = 0\nlast_key = \"\"\ntotal_keys = 0\ntotal_time = 0\naverage_speed = 0\n\ndef on_press(key):\n    global last_key, typing_start, total_keys, total_time\n    last_key = key\n    if not typing_start:\n        typing_start = time.time()\n\ndef on_release(key):\n    pass\n\n# Register event handlers\nkeyboard.on_press_keydown = on_press\nkeyboard.on_release_keyup = on_release\n\ntry:\n    keyboard.wait()  # Keep the script running indefinitely\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt:\n    print(\"Script interrupted, analyzing typing data...\")\n\n# Analyze typing data\ntyping_duration = time.time() - typing_start\ntotal_keys += len(last_key)  # Count number of keys pressed (assuming each character corresponds to a key)\ntotal_time += typing_duration\naverage_speed = total_keys / total_time if total_keys > 0 else 0\n\nprint(f\"Total keys: {total_keys}\")\nprint(f\"Total time: {total_time}\")\nprint(f\"Average speed: {average_speed} characters per second\")\n```\n\nThis script will capture individual keystrokes and calculate basic typing statistics like total keys pressed, total time spent typing, and average typing speed. You can modify this script to store the data in a structured format or perform more complex analytics as needed. Good luck with your project!"

You can customize the script to log additional data as needed for your specific use case while ensuring that it respects user privacy and security standards."

We initialize some variables for tracking typing stats such as the start time, last keypress time, total keys pressed, typing speed, and accuracy. The `on_key_press()` function records the current time when a key is pressed, increments the total keys counter, and calculates the typing speed every second. The `on_key_release()` function is left empty as it's not needed for our purposes.\n\nThe script continuously calculates the typing speed (in WPM) and accuracy based on the recorded data. To improve the adaptive input methods, you can analyze the generated statistics to better understand typing challenges faced by users with motor disabilities and tailor your technology accordingly."
